writing test in phpunit.xml 
php artisan make:test

  What should the test be named?
‚ùØ JobTest


  Which type of test would you like?
  Feature ................................................ testing a wide spectrum of your application -- when i visit such and such page i expect to see that or when i make a post request to this controller then validation should occur and i should see such and such in db -- think testing a very wide range of your project 
  Unit ..................................... far more narrow  when i instantiate this class and i call that method then i expect such and such response -- how narrowe thats end up being differs based on the community for eg would testing an elequent model that  hits the db is that unit test soem say absolutely not i say sure who cares just make up your mind 

  we will be using unit
